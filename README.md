## What is this project
This project is a JavaFX project representing a Calculator which can be used for infix or rpn calculations

## What does this project do
When you run the program, you are presented with a GUI of the Calculator. There is a field for you to input an expression and you need to make sure the selected expression type, (infix or reverse polish) which you choose with the radiobuttons, matches the type of your expression. If it does, then the calculator will calculate the answer to your expression and show it to you in the answer field.
The calculator only takes whole numbers as inputs but can return decimal values of answers when needed (for example when doing 5 / 2 the answer will be 2.5).
